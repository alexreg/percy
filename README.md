# What is an isomorphic web app?
[isomorphic-web-apps]: #isomorphic-web-apps

An isomorphic web app is a web application that allows the same application and code (in this case Rust code) to be run on both the server-side and the client-side (that is, in the browser).

# API Documentation

- [virtual-dom-rs API docs](https://chinedufn.github.io/percy/api/virtual_dom_rs/macro.html.html)

- [css-rs-macro API docs](https://chinedufn.github.io/percy/api/css_rs_macro)

## Initial Background / Motivation

I started using Rust in January 2018 and quickly got to the stage of "I REALLY want to use this for everything, even if it isn't the best tool for the job."

I need to make a website for a game that I'm working on, but the Rust ecosystem for frontend web apps with server side rendering is still very immature.

So I started working on a standalone virtual-dom implementation that could render to an HTML string on the server side and to a DOM element in the browser.

But then I realized that I wanted something similar to [sheetify](https://github.com/stackcss/sheetify).. And probably a couple other base web dev primitives too..

So I decided to make a cargo workspace with the tools that I needed to build isomorphic web apps in Rust. And here we are!

## Getting Started

For an example of an isomorphic web app in Rust check out the [isomorphic example](examples/isomorphic)

For more on the `html!` macro see [html macro](virtual-dom-rs/src/html_macro.rs)

```rust
#![feature(use_extern_macros)]
#![feature(proc_macro_non_items)]

#[macro_use]
extern crate virtual_dom_rs;

extern crate css_rs_macro;
use css_rs_macro::css;

static SOME_COMPONENT_CSS: &'static str = css! {"
:host {
    font-size: 30px;
    font-weight: bold;
}

:host > span {
    color: blue;
}
"};

fn main () {
  let count = Rc::new(Cell::new(0));

  let count_clone = Rc::clone(count);

  let html = html! {
    <div id="hello-world", class=*SOME_COMPONENT_CSS,>
      <span>{ "Hey :)" }</span>
      <button
        !onclick=|| { count_clone.set(count_clone.get() + 1); },
        // CSS in Rust isn't required. You can use regular old
        /* classes just fine! */
        class="btn-bs4 btn-bs4-success",
      >
        { "Click Me!" }
      </button>
    </div>
  };

  println!("{}", html.to_string());
}
```

## Running the example isomorphic web app locally

Install the WASM compiler, if you haven't already. See [Setup WASM target](https://www.hellorust.com/setup/wasm-target/) for more information:

```sh
rustup target add wasm32-unknown-unknown --toolchain nightly
```

Then clone the source and run:

```sh
git clone https://github.com/chinedufn/percy
cd percy
./examples/isomorphic/start.sh
```

## More Examples

- [Isomorphic web app](examples/isomorphic)
- [CSS in Rust](examples/css-in-rust)
- [Open an Issue or PR if you have an idea for a useful example!](https://github.com/chinedufn/percy/issues)

Now visit `http://127.0.0.1:7878` !

## Contributing

Please open issues / PRs explaining your intended use case and let's see if we should or shouldn't make `percy` support it!

Also feel free to open issues and PRs with any questions / thoughts that you have!

## To test

To run all of the Rust unit tests, Rust integration tests, and Node.js + WebAssembly tests run:

```sh
npm install
./test.sh
```

You'll need to be on Node.js 10.5+
